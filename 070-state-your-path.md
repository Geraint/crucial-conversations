# State your path

> How to speak persuasively, not abrasively

## Sharing Risky Meaning

- Maintain Safety
    - Confidence - have the courage to speak
    - Humility - others may have something valuable to contribute
    - Skill - don't make a Fool's Choice

## STATE My Path

See -> Story -> Feel -> Act

- *What* to do
    - **S**hare your facts
    - **T**ell your story
    - **A**sk for others' paths
- *How* to do it
    - **T**alk tentatively
    - **E**ncourage testing

## Share your facts

See -> Story -> Feel -> Act

- Remember you are at the end of the path to action model, so retrace your path
- Facts are the least controversial
- Facts are the most persuasive
- Starting with offensive conclusions encourages others to tell Villain Stories about us
- Facts are the least insulting
- Separate your facts from your stories *ideally before* entering a crucial conversation
- Begin your path with facts - first the facts, then the (possible) story

## Tell Your Story

See -> Story -> Feel -> Act

- It takes confidence - particularly if your story is negative
    - But if your story is based on facts, then you are likely drawing a reasonable, rational, and decent conclusion
- Don't pile it on
    - Don't let a problem build up over a period of time
- Look for safety problems
    - Use contrasting

## Ask for Others' Paths

See -> Story -> Feel -> Act

- This takes humility
- Expands the pool of meaning
    - You might learn something new, which suggests a very different story
- Encourage others to express their facts, stories, and feelings

## Talk Tentatively

- Tell your story *as* a story, not a hard fact
    - "I was wondering why..."
    - "Perhaps you were unaware..."
    - "In my opinion..."
- Strike a blend between confidence and humility
    - ~~"The fact is..."~~ -> "In my opinion..."
    - ~~"Everybody knows that..."~~ -> "I've talked to three of suppliers who think that..."
    - ~~"It's clear to me that..."~~ -> "I'm beginning to wonder if..."
- Tentative, not wimpy
    - ~~"I know this is probably not true..."~~
    - ~~"Call me crazy, but..."~~

## Examples of talking tentatively

- Example 1
    - Too soft: "This is probably stupid, but..."
    - Too hard: "How come you ripped us off?"
    - Just right: "It's starting to look like you're taking this for your own use.  Is that right?"
- Example 2
    - Too soft: "It's probably my fault, but..."
    - Too hard: "You wouldn't trust your own mother to boil an egg"
    - Just right: "I'm starting to feel like you don't trust me.  Is that what's going on here?  If so, I'd like to know what I did to lose your trust."

## Encourage Testing

- Invite opposing views
    - *"Does anyone see it differently?"*
    - *"What am I missing here?"*
    - *"I'd really like to hear the other side of this story"*
- Mean it
- Play devil's advocate

## Strong Belief

- It starts with a story
- We feel justified in using dirty tricks
    - selective with facts we share
    - exaggeration
    - appealing to authority
    - personal attacks
- The more forceful we are, the more we damage our relationships

## How do we change?

- Learn to look
    - are others going to silence or violence?
    - are you?
- Tone it down
    - others may have something to contribute
    - catch yourself before you launch into a monologue
    - avoid harsh and conclusive language
- Hold to your belief, but soften your approach
- When you've gotten yourself under control, you can use your STATE skills
