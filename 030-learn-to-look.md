# Learn to look

- What happens to you when a conversation turns crucial?
    - is it physical, like a dry mouth or a tightening of the stomach?
    - is it emotional?  Do you get angry, scared, or hurt?
    - is it behavioral?  Do you raise your voice, or become very quiet?
- Separate the *Content* of the conversation from the *Conditions* of the conversation
- Learn to look for Safety Problems
    - when its safe, you can say, or hear, just about anything
    - when its *not* save, your emotions crank up, and your brain shuts down
    - when you detect safety problems, Start With Heart to Find Your Bearings
- Don't let others' Safety Problems lead you astray
    - they could become aggressive
    - *don't* attack - instead, try to increase safety
