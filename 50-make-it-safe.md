# Make It Safe

How to make it safe to talk about almost anything

- Step Out
- Make It Safe
- Step Back In

## Which Condition Is At Risk?

- Mutual Purpose - the Entrance Condition
    - Do others believe your care about their goals in this conversation?
    - Do they trust your motives?
    - Before the conversation begins, Start With Heart
- Mutual Respect - the Continuance Condition
    - People who do not respect each other cannot stay in dialogue
    - You can always respect and honor a person's basic humanity
        - How are we similar?
        - We all have weaknesses

## What To Do Once You've Stepped Out

- Apologize
- Contrast
- Create A Mutual Purpose

### Apologize

- Only When Its Appropriate
- Must be sincere
- Don't try to save face - focus on what you *really* want
- A sincere show of respect can restore safety

### Contrast

- Fix misunderstanding
- Contrasting is not apologising
- A don't/do statement:
    - address concerns that you don't respect them or have malicious purpose (the *don't* part)
    - confirms respect, and clarifies real purpose (the *do* part)
- For example:
    - (*don't* part) The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don't value the work you're doing
    - (*do* part) I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular
- Once safety is restored, you can return to the Content of the conversation
- Contrasting provides context and proportion
- Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid

### Create a Mutual Purpose

- CRIB
    - Commit to Seek A Mutual Purpose
        - Commit to staying in the conversation until we invent a solution that serves a purpose we both share
        - We must not be stubborn - there may be a mutually acceptable third way
        - We may want to verbalise our commitment
    - Recognise the Purpose Behind the Strategy
        - Why do you want that?  e.g. Purpose: want peace and quiet; Strategy: stay at home
        - When you separate strategies from purpose, new options become possible
    - Invent a Mutual Purpose
        - For when you have incompatible goals, and you can't *discover* a mutual purpose
        - Move to more encompassing goals
    - Brainstorm New Strategies
