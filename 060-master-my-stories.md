# Master My Stories

> How to stay in dialogue when you're angry, scared, or hurt

## Emotions Don't Just Happen

- Other don't make you mad - *you* make you mad
- Once you have created upset emotions you have two options:
    - Act on them (master them)
    - Be acted upon by them (become hostage to them)

## Feelings Drive Actions

Feel | Act
---- | ---
hurt | silence
worried | cheap shots

## Stories Create Feelings

### The Path to Action model

See & Hear -> Tell A Story -> Feel -> Act

Mnemonic:
~~S.T.F.U.~~
S.T.F.A.

## Example - Maria's Path to Action

See & Hear | Tell A Story | Feel | Act
---------- | ------------ | ---- | ---
Louis makes all the points, meets privately with boss | He doesn't trust me.  Thinks I'm weak.  If I speak up, I'll look emotional.  | hurt, worried | silence, cheap shots

## Our Stories

- Even if you don't realise it, you are telling yourself stories
- Blindingly fast, so you don't usually notice
- Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories
- If we take control of our stories, they won't control us
    - we control how we feel
    - this lets us control how we act
- If you want to be better at crucial conversations, change the stories you tell yourself - even while you're in the middle of the fray

## Skills for Mastering Our Stories

- Slow down
- Retrace your Path
    - Act - notice your behaviour
        - ask yourself "am I in some form a silence or violence?"
        - be honest with yourself
    - Feel - get in touch with your feelings
        - ask yourself "what emotions are encouraging me to act this way?"
        - try to be accurate - don't just say "I feel bad" or "I feel angry" when you're actually feeling embarassed, suprised, or humliated
    - Tell Story - analyse your stories
        - ask yourself "what story is creating these emotions?"
        - **most important point** - challenge the illusion that your story is the only possible interpretation of the facts
        - don't confuse stories with facts
    - See/Hear - get back to the facts
        - what evidence do I have to support this story?
        - Separate fact from story by focusing on behaviour
            - Can you *see* or *hear* this thing you're calling a fact?  Was it an actual behaviour?
        - Spot the story by watching for "hot" words
            - "she *scowled* at me", "he made a *saracstic* comment" contain hot words
            - "her eyes pinched shut and her lips tightened" does not contain hot words

## Beware "Clever" Stories

- Allow you to justify your silence/violence
- Allow you to feel good about behaving badly

## Victim Stories

- It's Not My Fault
- The other person is bad, wrong or dumb
- We are good, right or brilliant
- There's no such thing as an innocent victim (in a crucial conversation)
- When yourself tell a Victim Story, you intentionally ignore your role in the problem
- We exaggerate our innocence

## Villain Stories

- Turn normal, decent human beings into villains
- We attribute bad motive to them, and portray them as evil
- We exaggerate the other person's guilt or stupidity
- We ignore the other person's good qualities
    - Labeling

## Helpless Stories

- There's nothing else I can do
- Often stem from Villain Stories
    - "she's a control freak (villain story), so I can't give her feedback (helpless story)"
      - typically offer us a Fool's Choice

## Why We Tell Clever Stories

- Clever stories match reality (sometimes they are accurate)
- Clever stories get us off the hook (excuse us from responsibility)
- Clever stories keeping us from acknowledging our own sellouts
    - we must have done something that we feel the need to justify
    - so, we either own up to this sellout, or we try to justify it

## Some Common Sellouts That Can Cause Us To Tell Clever Stores

- You believe you should help someone, but don't
- You believe you should apologise, but don't
- You believe you should stay late to finish up a commitment, but go home instead
- You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no one follows up to see if you keep your commitment
- You do less than your share and think you should acknowledge it, but say nothing knowing no one else will bring it up either

## Tell the Rest of the Story

- Turn victims into actors
    - am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem?
- Turn villains into humans
    - why would a reasonable, rational and decent person do what this person is doing?
- Turn the helpless into the able
    - what do I really want?  For me?  For others?  For the relationship?
    - kill the Fool's Choice - what would I do right now if I really wanted these results?
