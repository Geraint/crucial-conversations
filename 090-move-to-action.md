# Move To Action

> How to Turn Crucial Conversations into Action and Results

## Why do Teams/Families fail to convert ideas into action?

- Unclear expectations about *how* decisions will be made
- Do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make

## Dialogue Is Not Decision Making

### Riskiest Times of Crucial Conversations

- Beginning - you have to create safety
- End - without clarity, we can get violated expectations
    - How are decisions going to be made?
    - Will we ever decide?

## Decide How To Decide

- everyone should share meaning
- not everyone *necessarily* partakes in the decision
- To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making

### When The Line Of Authority Is Clear

Those in authority decide on the method of decision making

- Managers
- Parents

### When The Line Of Authority Is Not Clear

- Use dialogue to decide on the method of decision making

## The Four Methods of Decision Making

- Command
- Consult
- Vote
- Consensus

### Command

Decisions that are made with no involvement

- Outside forces
    - Customers set prices
    - Agencies set safety standards
- Decisions that we turn over to others
    - Delegate
    - In strong teams, many decisions are delegated to trusted individuals

### Consult

Decision makers invite input from:

- Experts
- A representative population
- All interested parties

A good way to gain ideas and support, without bogging down decision making process.

You can:

- Gather ideas
- Evaluate options
- Make a choice
- Inform the broader population

### Vote

Good choice for efficiency and time saving, if you're selecting from a number of good options.

Should *never* be used when team members don't agree to support whatever decision is made (use Consensus instead)

### Consensus

A blessing a frustrating curse.

Talk until everyone agrees.

Pros:

- Creates unity
- High quality decisions

Cons:

- Can be a huge waste of time

Only use when:

- High stakes and complex or issues

*or*

- Everyone **must** support the final choice

## How to Choose

### Four Important Questions.

1. Who cares?
    - Don't involve people who don't care
1. Who knows?
    - Involve experts.
    - Don't involve people who do not contribute new information
1. Who must agree?
    - Who's co-operation/authority will you need?
    - You don't want to surprise them, and earn their resistance
1. How man people is it worth involving?
    - Goal is the fewest possible
    - Ask: "do we have enough people to make a good choice/get others' commitment?"

## Make Assignments - Put Decisions Into Action

Make sure that decisions are acted up by a person or team

- Who?
    - There's no "we".  "We" means "not me".
    - Assign a *name* to every responsibility.
    - If more than one person, make one of them *the* responsible party.
- Does what?
    - Clarify exact deliverables
    - Use contrasting to clarify
    - If possible, point to physical examples (pictures, prototypes)
    - Avoids unpleasant surprises
- By when?
    - Goals without deadlines produce guilt, not results
- How will you follow up?
    - Agree method
    - Examples:
        - email to confirm completion
        - full report in team/family meeting
        - progress checks
        - call me when you're done
        - milestones

## Document Your Work

> One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds

- Record
    - Conclusions
    - Decisions
    - Assignments
- Revisit notes at key times (e.g. in the next meeting)
- Hold people accountable for their assignments
    - when they fail, use STATE skills
    - increases motivation and ability to deliver
    - creates a culture of integrity

## Summary

    - Command
    - Consult
    - Vote
    - Consensus
- Finish Clearly
    - *Who* does *What"
    - Clarify deliverables
    - Set follow up time
