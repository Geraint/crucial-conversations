> How to Turn Crucial Conversations into Action and Results

## Why do Teams/Families fail to convert ideas into action?

- Unclear expectations about *how* decisions will be made
- Do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make

## Dialogue Is Not Decision Making

### Riskiest Times

- Beginning - you have to create safety
- End - without clarity, we can get violated expectations
    - How are decisions going to be made?
    - Will we ever decide?

## Decide How To Decide

- everyone should share meaning
- not everyone *necessarily* partakes in the decision
- To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making

### When The Line Of Authority Is Clear

Those in authority decide on the method of decision making

- Managers
- Parents

### When The Line Of Authority Is Not Clear

- Use dialogue to decide on the method of decision making

## The Four Methods of Decision Making

- Command
- Consult
- Vote
- Consensus
