    - the other person is already in Silence or Violence
- *Break the cycle*
    - we are conditioned to respond poorly
    - we need to stay calm and collected, and get them to *tell their story*
    - i.e. we need to get *them* to retrace *their* Path to Action
    - this can help both parties to overcome negative emotions
