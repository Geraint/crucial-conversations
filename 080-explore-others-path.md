## Explore Others' Path

> How to listen when others blow up or clam up

## Start with heart - get ready to listen

- Be sincere
    - Don't pretend to be interested
- Be curious
    - They may have valuable contributions to the pool of meaning
- Stay curious
    - They may have told themselves a villain story about you
    - Ask yourself "why would a reasonable, rational, decent human being think this?"
- Be patient
    - Emotions take time to subside

## Encourage Others To Retrace Their Path

The Path to Action model

See -> Story -> Feel -> Act

- We're joining at the *end* of the Path to Action - in the Act phase
    - the other person is already in Silence or Violence
- *Break the cycle*
    - we are conditioned to respond poorly
    - we need to stay calm and collected, and get them to *tell their story*
    - i.e. we need to get *them* to retrace *their* Path to Action
    - this can help both parties to overcome negative emotions
